This is a collection of notes taken from F-Prime's documentation to hopefully explain some parts of it better than they do. Feel free to offer criticisms at will.

The document `Documentation Errors` is there to help record any small spelling errors within the F Prime documentation and eventually send them to F Prime as GitHub issues
 - Always record any documentation errors, even if you're unsure if it's an error or not, doesn't hurt to make sure. 
 - Take the approach of saying 'erm actually' about any small issue you find, because one small error to you could be the difference between someone else understanding the documentation or not.
