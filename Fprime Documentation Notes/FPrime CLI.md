 - To start the GDS in headless mode `fprime-gds -g none`
	 - then to run any commands or whatever you use the `fprime-cli` tool
 - What you can do with the CLI
	 - `channels` - you can receive the values of open telemetry channels  - receives data
	 - `command-send` - sends commands to the deployment
	 - `events` - allows to receive events the deployment is recording - receives data
	 - to use these the format is `fprime-cli [COMMAND]`
		 - ex. `fprime-cli channels`
 - Just like the regular GDS, it uses the autogenerated dictionary to know what commands and things are available
	 - if for whatever reason it couldn't find the dictionary, you can specify where to look for it by using the command `fprime-cli [COMMAND] --dictionary /path/to/dictionary`
		 - where `[COMMAND]` is one of the options previously mentioned
 - Receiving events and channel data
	 - when you request to receive events or channel data, it just prints it all out into the console
	 - there's several ways to filter out what information you want and what you don't
		 - `-i /--ids` - prints only data with the matching numeric id's 
			 - ex. `fprime-cli events --ids 1 2 3`
		 - `-c / --components` - only print items generated by the specified component instances
			 - ex. `fprime-cli channels --components pingRcvr` - this will only display data sent from the component named `pingRcvr`
		 - `s / --search` - only prints strings containing the (case-sensitive) search term provided
			 - ex. `fprime-cli events --search WARNING_LO` - this will only display `WARNING_LO` events from `pingRcvr`
			 - this will only take a single search string
	 - combining these filters will allow for you to narrow your search
	 - to see the full list of all events or channels available, use the `-l / --list` flag to list everything in the dictionary 
		 - ex. `fprime-cli events -l` will list all known events for the project
	 - to get the most detailed information about what is being sent or received, use the `-j / --json` flag to print out the full data objects in their JSON format
 - Sending commands
	 - to send a command that has no arguments, simply type the name of the command
		 - ex. `fprime-cli command-send cmdDisp.CMD_NO_OP` - the command in this case being `cmdDisp.CMD_NO_OP`
	 - to send a command that has arguments, use the `-args / --arguments` option after the name of the command
		 - ex. `fprime-cli command-send health.HLTH_CHNG_PING --arguments eventLogger 50 20`
		 - to pass in strings, simply surround them in quotes `"like this"`
	 - just like with events and channel data, you can see a list of all commands by using the command - `fprime-cli command-send -l`
 - to scp something to your computer `scp gas@pi0.gas.usu.edu:~/photos/testing1 ~/Desktop/`
