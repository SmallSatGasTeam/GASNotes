	 - When describing warning lo and hi for events under components, it says warning lo and warning lo, the second warning should say 'warning hi'
 - In the FPP user guide, the example shown in 9.6.2 is partially wrong
	 - when describing `Event 2`, it states the example output would look like `"Saw value [ 0.001, 0.002, 0.003] for case A"`, when it would actually look something like `"Saw value A for case [ 0.001, 0.002, 0.003]"`
		 - This is because the `case` parameter is declared before the `value` parameter. Ironically, the behavior of how parameter order correlates to the format string is the exact behavior they're trying to display here.
 - In the FPP user guide, under 11.4.1 Importing Instances and Connections
	 - When explaining what the FPP translator does when given the example, on the fourth point it states 'Resolve the pattern graph specifies of B', when the word 'specifies' should be 'specifiers'
