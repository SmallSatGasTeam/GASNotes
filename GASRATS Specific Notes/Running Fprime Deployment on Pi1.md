# Running Fprime Deployment on Pi1.md
*  Note: This assumes that you have already cross compiled for the pi, if you haven't, look at "Connecting the F' gds to a pi.md".

## Script on Pi1
*  There is a script on the Pi1 called *runDeployment.sh* which takes the arguments:
   *  "[-h gives a help/usage mesage]
   *  "[-d deployment name]"
*  This script runs the code on the pi.
